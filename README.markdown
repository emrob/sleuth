# Sleuth

The principle behind Sleuth is simple: You shouldn't have to modify your code to
debug it. We've all been guilty of inserting a print() statement here or there
instead of taking the time to fire up a debugger. With Sleuth, you can debug and
profile your Python code without the hassle of inserting and removing debugging
statements.

## In development!

Sleuth is still very much in development. Nothing is guaranteed to work at the
moment. Please check back in the near future for updates :)
